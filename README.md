## Application Stack
The Roar Application Stack comprises the following distinct layers:

- **Web**  
  _Apache+PHP web layer_  
  Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes to the App layer.

- **Leaderboard**  
  _PHP+MySQL leaderboard module_  
  A sub-module dedicated to handling leaderboards.

- **Application**  
  _C++ Roar socket application_  
  The core game engine (the server itself).

- **DB**  
  _Postgres app DB layer_  
  Used to persist application data (eg. players, items, etc).


## Setting up
Roar is officially supported on **[Ubuntu Server 12.04 64bit](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)** [[1]](#footnote-1). We recommend running Roar using **Amazon Web Services** ([AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)), and as such make references to AWS in our docs from time to time. You may of course run your servers wherever you wish.

We recommend running Roar in AWS with the following starting config:

- 1x EC2 x-large node (application + db + leaderboard)
